# Active learning: playing with scope and headers

1. For this final exercise, we'd like you to first make local copies of items-sold.html and minimal-table.css, in a new directory.
2. Now try adding in the appropriate scope attributes to make this table more appropriate.
3. Finally, try making another copy of the starter files, and this time make the table more accessible using id and headers attributes.
