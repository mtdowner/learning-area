[Optional extension modules](/curriculum/3-extensions): These "extension" topics constitute useful additional skills to learn as web developers start to expand their knowledge and develop specialisms.

- [Extension 1 CSS transforms and animation](/curriculum/3-extensions/1-css-transforms-and-animation.md): Animations are a vital part of a good user experience. Subtle usage can make page designs more interesting and appealing, and also enhance usability and perceived performance.
- [Extension 2 Creating your own JavaScript objects](/curriculum/3-extensions/2-creating-your-own-javascript-objects.md): Having a deeper knowledge of how JavaScript objects work is very useful as you build confidence with web development, start to build more complex apps, and create your own libraries.
- [Extension 3 Web APIs](/curriculum/3-extensions/3-web-apis.md): This module covers common aspects of three of the most common classes of Web APIs that we haven't previously covered in any kind of detail, providing a useful grounding for those who want to go deeper into browser API usage.
- [Extension 4 Performance](/curriculum/3-extensions/4-performance.md): Performance centers around making your websites as fast as possible, both in real terms (for example small file sizes, quicker loading), and in terms of how performance is perceived (for example getting initial content to a usable state as fast as possible, even if all the content is not yet loaded).
- [Extension 5 Security and privacy](/curriculum/3-extensions/5-security-and-privacy.md): It is vital to have an understanding of how you can and should protect your data and your user's data from would-be attackers who may try to steal it. This module covers both hardening websites to make it more difficult to steal data, and collecting user data in a respectful way that avoids tracking them or sharing it with unsuitable third parties.
- [Extension 6 Testing](/curriculum/3-extensions/6-testing.md): Any codebase past a certain level of complexity needs to have a system of tests associated with it, to make sure that as new code is added, the codebase continues to function correctly and performantly, and continues to meet the users' needs. This module lists the fundamentals that you should start with.
- [Extension 7 A practical understanding of JavaScript frameworks](/curriculum/3-extensions/7-a-practical-understanding-of-javascript-frameworks.md): JavaScript frameworks are commonly used to build web applications, so it is beneficial to learn about common frameworks and use cases (as listed below) for employment prospects.
- [Extension 8 CSS tooling](/curriculum/3-extensions/8-css-tooling.md): Tooling is not just confined to JavaScript frameworks. There are also common CSS tooling types that you'll encounter on your learning journey.
- [Extension 9 Other tooling types](/curriculum/3-extensions/9-other-tooling-types.md): There are other types of tooling that you'll commonly encounter on a web project. This module aims to provide a useful list to research.
