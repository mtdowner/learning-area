# MDN Curriculum Work Files

This repo contains my exercise files for MDN's Frontend Learning Path. The original repo is [here](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/) and the learning material is [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn).

The content is split up into different repos (probably to confuse me even more).

HTML - Structuring the web

CSS - Styling the web
